/**
 * Preview tiers — the difference between iterating on a demo and batch-rendering
 * one.
 *
 * A ten-minute render is minutes of waiting, and nobody tunes an annotation
 * against that. Both tiers here are command-line flags before they are anything
 * else: they pay for themselves at the terminal, and a UI that wants a preview
 * button later builds on the same verb rather than beside it.
 *
 *  - `--draft` renders the whole film small, at a low frame rate, video only,
 *    speaking only lines already in the voice cache. For seeing whether it
 *    flows.
 *  - `--only <beat>` renders one section at full quality. For seeing whether
 *    one shot is right.
 *
 * Neither changes what the demo *does*. A draft drives the same app through the
 * same steps and would produce the same master if asked to; that is what makes
 * it a preview of the real thing rather than a different film.
