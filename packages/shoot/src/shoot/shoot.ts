/**
 * `reel shoot` — film the app, and stop there.
 *
 * ## What this is, and why it is not `reel record`
 *
 * `record` produces a *finished* video: browser chrome, burned-in captions,
 * title cards, fades, the lot. That was the right shape when Reel was the whole
 * pipeline. It is the wrong shape when the film is cut in a composition, because
 * every one of those decisions is now someone else's to make, and a decision
 * baked into a frame cannot be unmade.
 *
 * So `shoot` films the app and nothing else. No frame, no captions in the
 * picture, no title cards, no fade at either end — those become clips in the
 * composition, where they can be restyled, retimed, translated or cut. What
 * comes out is footage plus a manifest of everything the driver knows about
 * what it just filmed.
 *
 * The camera is the one judgement call. Zoom stays on by default: a push-in is
 * a property of the *shot* — it was chosen while the app was being driven, with
 * the element's real box in hand — and it cannot be recovered later from a flat
 * recording without upscaling. `--flat` turns it off for compositions that want
 * to do their own framing.

 * but a wrong selector discovered at step 74 of 94, four times in a row, each
 * discovery costing another full run.
 *
 * The driver has always had a mode for this (`check`: real navigation, real
 * state waits, no holds, no encode); it simply was not reachable from `shoot`.

 * a manifest describing a recording that does not exist — and the manifest is
