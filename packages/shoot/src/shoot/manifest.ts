/**
 * The shot manifest — what Reel hands to a composition.
 *
 * ## Why this file is the whole point
 *
 * HyperFrames renders HTML to video, and it is very good at it. What it has no
 * way to produce is *footage of a real product doing a real thing*: its own
 * `capture` reads a website's design — screenshots, tokens, fonts — so an agent
 * can rebuild it, which is a different job from driving an app through a flow
 * and filming what happened.
 *
 * Reel does exactly that job, and always has. So the two fit together the
 * obvious way: Reel shoots the footage, HyperFrames cuts the film. This
 * manifest is the seam.
 *
 * A bare `.mp4` would be a poor seam. A composition needs to *time* things
 * against the footage — a lower third when the user clicks Add, a punch-in on
 * the moment the list updates, a chapter card between two sections — and
 * without a manifest an author is left scrubbing an mp4 and guessing at
 * timestamps. The driver already knows every one of those moments, because it
 * caused them. Writing them down costs nothing and is the difference between
 * footage you can edit and footage you can only play.

 * went down — which no editor can do by ear afterwards, because only the driver

 * cannot be unmade" — and it is now unnecessary, because the composition draws
 * cards far better than a burn-in ever did, out of the frame presets and the
 * blueprints.
 *
 * So a card leaves the shoot as a marker: what it said, and where in the film
 * it belongs. It occupies no footage time at all, because a card is its own
 * scene in the composition rather than a stretch of the recording.
