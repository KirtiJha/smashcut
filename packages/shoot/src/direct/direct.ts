 * Direction, proposed.
 *
 * The primitives — camera, highlight, drift, establishing shots — still have to
 * be *placed*, and placing them is the work most people will not do. But Reel
 * knows more about its own footage than any stock-footage tool knows about a
 * clip: every step, every element it names, every narration line, every beat.
 * That is what lets a proposal be specific enough to be worth reading.
 *
 * Deterministic, and offline. The match that matters — "this line talks about
 * the thing that step points at" — is a text comparison between a narration
 * line and the *name inside a selector*, and a rule you can explain beats a
 * model you cannot. It also means `direct` needs no key, no network and no
 * browser, and runs in milliseconds on a spec you are still editing.
 *
 * Nothing is applied silently. Direction is taste; a tool that quietly
 * restages your film is worse than one that suggests.
